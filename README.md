Or so-called "tomato timer" with the idea of a pause-able timer that continuously running in 
either "regular session count down" mode or "break time count down" mode.

User may increase/decrease session time and break time up to certain limit.  Click the big
button to start/stop the timer.  When time counts down to 0, a special sound will play to
